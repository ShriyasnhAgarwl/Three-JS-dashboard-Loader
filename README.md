# 3D Product Viewer

## About
This project is a 3D visualization tool built using React and Three.js, specifically designed for viewing 3D models directly in the web browser. It features a drag-and-drop component that exclusively supports GLB files, enabling users to easily upload and visualize 3D products.

## Features
- **3D Model Viewing**: Visualize 3D products in high quality directly in your browser.
- **Drag and Drop**: Effortlessly upload GLB files using the drag-and-drop interface.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and functional on various devices and screen sizes.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/art3miz18/Three-JS-dashboard/tree/three-js-loader
   cd three-js-loader
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Usage

After starting the app, you can use the drag-and-drop interface to upload any GLB file. The application will automatically render the 3D model in the viewport, allowing you to interact with the model using mouse controls.
